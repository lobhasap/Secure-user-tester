            There’s nothing cookie-cutter about Pizza Hut. Not our pizzas. Not
            our people. And definitely not the way we live life. Around here, we
            don’t settle for anything less than food we’re proud to serve. And
            we don’t just clock in. Not when we can also become our best, make
            friends, and have fun while we’re at it. We’re the pizza company
            that lives life unboxed.

            <h1>WHERE WE COME FROM</h1>
            <p>
              In 1958, two brothers borrowed $600 from their mom to open a pizza
              place in Wichita, Kansas. They named it Pizza Hut, because their
              sign only had room for eight letters. How profound! Soon, the
              restaurant grew. Why? The pizza was awesome. The service felt like
              home. And the customers were treated like family. And we’ve been
              delivering that same food and service ever since.

            <h1>WHAT WE’RE ABOUT</h1>
            <p>
              At Pizza Hut, we don’t just make pizza. We make people happy.
              Pizza Hut was built on the belief that pizza night should be
              special, and we carry that belief into everything we do. With more
              than 55 years of experience under our belts, we understand how to
              best serve our customers through tried and true service
              principles: We create food we’re proud to serve and deliver it
              fast, with a smile.

            <p>
              n June 1996, Pizza Hut made its foray into India with a restaurant
              in Bangalore and was the first international restaurant chain to
              pioneer this category. The restaurant brand offers an exciting
              menu consisting of its signature pizzas, appetizers, pastas,
              desserts and beverages. Its trademark dining experience has been
              recognized by Brand Equity to make it the ‘Most Trusted Food
              Service Brand’ for 11 years in a row. Pizza Hut is the most
              preferred pizza brand in India, given its freshest, tastiest and
              affordable Pizzas.
